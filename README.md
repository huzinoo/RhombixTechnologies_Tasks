## 📌 Project Details
- **Brand:** Nike  
- **Theme:** 50% Off Sale (Sports Shoes)  
- **Size:** Instagram Post – 1080x1350 px  
- **Style:** Minimal, clean, product-focused  
- **Tool Used:** Adobe Photoshop  

I kept the shoes in the center, added bold “50% OFF” text with a transparent overlay, and placed the Nike logo + tagline *“Just Do It”* to give it an authentic brand look. The aim was to keep it simple yet attractive.
